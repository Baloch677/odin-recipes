    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sajji (Balochi and Urdu: سجی) is a Balochi dish originating from the Balochistan province of Pakistan.[1]

        Traditional and authentic sajji consists of lamb, marinated only in salt with a few spices. 
        Sajji is considered done when it is at the 'rare' stage. It is served with rice that is cooked inside the animal, 
        which is baked in an oven, wrapped around a stone "tandoor". Regional varieties are found with subtle differences in flavouring. 
        Notably, in the urban centres of Karachi, Islamabad or Lahore, chicken is used instead of lamb, the sajji is roasted until 
        it is medium or well-done and is served with rice instead of Balochistan's traditional Kaak bread.
