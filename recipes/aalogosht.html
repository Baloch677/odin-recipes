    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Aloo gosht (Hindi: आलू गोष्ठ, Urdu: آلو گوشت, Bengali: আলু গোশ্ত Alu göshto, Assamese: আলু গোছ Alu güs) is a meat curry, 
        originating in Shahjahanabad, India (now Old Delhi)[1] and is a popular dish in North Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi 
        cuisine. It consists of potatoes (aloo) cooked with meat (gosht), usually lamb or mutton or beef, in a stew-like shorba gravy.[2][3] 
        It may be considered a curry, stew, or shorba depending on the way the dish is prepared, the types of spices used and what country or 
        particular region it was made in. The dish can be served and eaten with plain rice or with bread such as roti, paratha or naan.</p>
